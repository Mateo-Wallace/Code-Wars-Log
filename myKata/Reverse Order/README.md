# Reverse Order

## Description

Given 2 whole numbers (`low` & `high`), write a function to find all whole numbers between the given values as an array. Return that array in reverse order.

### Tasks

- Optimize the current solution
- Create a solution that makes the `EXTRA TESTS` pass (string inputs, high to low)
- Write more robust tests
- Write a more robust description

### Example Starting Setup

```js
const reverseOrder = (low, high) => {
  // your code here
};
```
